  <h2>Programming Is Art<br>
    <span>Poem by Tea Kawana</span>
  </h2>
  <p>As if he were a painter,<br>
  he interpreted his thoughts using colour,<br>
  with his tools:<br>
  several brushes and a paint palette.<br>
  As if he played in some orchestra or band,<br>
  and the notes from the sheet music were <br>
  expressed through the very contact of his <br>
  instrument and himself; <br> 
  and the translation of the incomprehensible<br> 
  beautiful marks on the sheet, <br> 
  to a set theme, one could envision in the mind,<br> 
  was impeccably evident through play.<br>
  As if he were a dancer,<br>
  having polished up all the various essential techniquesâ€¦<br>
  and how the flexibility and movement of his body<br>
  extract the notation to beautiful action.<br>
  Through his own specialty,<br> 
  I see all these come into play,<br> 
  I see art. </p>
